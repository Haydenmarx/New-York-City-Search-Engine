# New York Search Engine
*A custom search experience for NYC*

### Why a custom search engine?

* New York Search Engine (NYSE) offers a unique single source of truth approach to finding out information about NYC. 

* Rather than needing to go different websites for court, public meeting or business information, NYSE offers all that information at single point with an easy to use interface.
